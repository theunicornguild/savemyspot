Congratulations on finishing this challenging project. You have accomplished and learned so much. Mainly, you now know how to use sockets and integrate them in any frontend you have. Just so you can appreciate what you've done, let's take a quick overview on the whole project:
 * `django`: has all the restaurant and queue information with their apis.
 * `node.js`: had the sockets implementation.
 * `react native`: the mobile application that allows users to see restaurant and join/leave queues which was done through sockets.
 * `react`: the restaurant side of things where restaurants can view the queue and seat customers and that was done through sockets too.

What a ride!!!
