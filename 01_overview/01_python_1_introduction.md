Let’s take a stroll down memory lane, remember that time you went to The Cheesecake Factory and were greeted by a lovely crowd that you couldn't help but wonder how long the wait is going to take? 
You approach the host who greets you with a deceptive smile as he informs you of the estimated wait time. You reluctantly decide to wait, the host enters your name and number of guests with you in their system. You are given a buzzer and sent on your way within a constrained radius.

What if you didn’t have to spend your time waiting around? What if you could enter a queue remotely and arrive at the restaurant just in time?

In this tutorial, you will be creating your very own queueing app!!
