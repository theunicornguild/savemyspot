In this project you'll be using both `trello` and `git`.


#### Trello

`Trello` is a tool used to help you keep track of your work. What you need to do...what you've already finished and so on.

Open the projects `Trello` board which you'll find in the `Resources` section. In the board you'll find 4 lists:
 * `IceBox`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that are nice to have but not necessary (iceboxed).
 * `Backlog`: this list has all the cards/functionalities that we need to do.
 * `Doing`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that you are currently working on.
 * `Finito`: this list will have all the cards/functionalities that are done.


\*Right now all the cards are in the `backlog` list because we haven't started working on the project. So, as we start working in this project, we'll be moving the cards to different lists.

#### Git

We'll be using git throughout the project to keep track of the changes we're making to the code and create checkpoints everytime we finish a functionality.

We're not going to start this project from scratch, so there is a starter project for you. After you fork and clone this project, each time we complete a certain functionality we'll push to that repo. If you're not familiar with forking and cloning, we'll go through that in the setup.
