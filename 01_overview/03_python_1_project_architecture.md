We will be creating two react apps to serve the two types of users - the customer and the restaurant. Each type of user requires a different view and different data to enjoy the true experience of the project. To serve the needs of the customer we will be using React Native to create a mobile app. As for the restaurant we will be using ReactJS to create a web app for the possibility of using this on a tablet or a desktop computer. These frontend components will be interacting with a Django backend and the web sockets through Node. 

The flow of the project is as follows: (INSERT DIAGRAM)

We will be using Node to set up our SocketIO server to communicate queuing information between the Django backend and React frontend. All other data such as restaurant names and menu details will be communicated directly from the Django API we create. 
 
If it seems confusing now, donâ€™t worry, it will start making sense when we start building. 

Okay cool, no need to delay any longer, lets spend some time now to save time later.
