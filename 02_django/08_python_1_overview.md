With this chapter, you should have the queue apis working:
 * List of queues objects belonging to a restaurant.
 * joining/creating a queue.
 * Leaving/deleting a queue.

Test those apis using [`postman`](https://www.getpostman.com/). Before testing them, you need to check the code to see if this request exprcts anything to be send in the body or in the url. For example, if you take a look at the `get` in the `QueueView` you'll notice that it uses `restaurant` that it recives from the request body.


When you're done testing don't forget to add, commit, and push.
