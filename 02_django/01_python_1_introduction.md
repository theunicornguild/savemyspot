In this chapter you'll be doing the django part of the project. Before starting, go into the django starter project and go through the models and apis that are already created. I'd also recommend using [`postman`](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test them out. 


The apis that you'll be creating are all related to the queue:
 * Adding a person to the queue.
 * Removing a person from a queue.
 * Retrieving a restaurant's queue.
