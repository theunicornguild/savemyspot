By the end of this chapter the customer side of this project should be done.

Customer Experience:  
\[x\] View current queue for each restaurant  
\[x\] Ability to join queue  
\[x\] Ability to leave queue


To complete these functionalities, We created a `socketStore` to make a conneteion to the node.js server. with this connection, the customer side of the project can now receive and emit data from and to the node.js server to complete all queue functionalities.


Test your project by running the node, django, and react projects. Go into any restaurant details and try to join a queue. After that try to leave a queue. If these functionalities worked then you can move the associated cards in trello to the finito list.
